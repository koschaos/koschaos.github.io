## Happy New Year, 2026!

I hope you are doing well as we start 2026. Finally, I actually posted one of these on January 1! :phew:

Last year, I opened the message with ...

> 2024 was ... something!

Apparently, I was wrong ... 2024 was *nothing* compared to 2025!  I'm not sure what to say about it, without turning this into a rant of unprintable epithets.

I'm not quite sure of the impact the current occupant of the White House has had in Ireland, but in Canada it's had a rather galvanizing, patriotic effect.  It's been the year of `#Never51` (in response to Trump's idea to make Canada the 51st state), `#CanadaIsNotForSale` (thanks to a hat worn by Ontario's Premier Doug Ford),  and `#ElbowsUp` (courtesy of Mike Myers miming out the phrase on Saturday Night Live).  For the non-Canadian's, or just anyone not familiar with hockey (i.e., me!), let this picture explain everything ...

### Kids' extracurriculars 🏃🎵

There's not much to report here. Éamon continued his piano practice and participated in the end-of-school-year recital that his teacher hosts in June.

*insert a photo of him performing*

Unfortunately, while training with the school cross-country team at the end of 2024, Aidan injured his foot, then had issues with a knee, then a hip, then the other hip ... he basically spent the majority of the track & field season injured and unable to compete.  All because the geniuses behind the school cross country team trained on *pavement*.  For the outdoor season, he didn't participate at all in any of the competitions.  There was a lot of sports massage/physiotherapy to try to fix him up!

The indoor track season is now underway and he had his first meet in mid-December ... he knocked over half-a-second off his previous PB in the 200m, so ... :fingers-crossed:


### Vacation

Because of a bit of Canadian pride ("elbows up"), we did not venture to Florida this year, much to Éamon's consternation.  Except for the pandemic years, we've gone there every Spring since 2013(?).  We were able to explain to him why we couldn't go during the pandemic years (basically not allowed!) but deciding to not go voluntarily was a little more challenging.

So, we decided to head to Halifax during the Summer instead, and convinced my sister to meet us there from Ireland.  She'd not been there, the boys hadn't been there, and Susan and I hadn't been there since before the boys were born.

Everything was looking good until the Air Canada Flight Attendants went on strike :facepalm:  After the fiasco with Air Canada two years ago on the return flight from Florida, we didn't want to fly with them again, but their flight times lined up better with the time my sister was landing from Ireland, so we said "what the heck".  In the days leading up to it, we paid closer attention to the news and, sure enough, they gave their 72 hour notice on the Wednesday before our Saturday morning flight.  Well, f%@&!

We knew there would be few other flights available so our only options were to cancel (which wasn't fair on my sister) or to drive.  In anticipation of driving, Susan suggested to get the car serviced in advance.  Wouldn't you know it, the cars brakes needed a full service! In fairness, the kilometers were at that point where it really did need to be done, and, given that we were facing a round-trip of about 4,000 km ... it was probably a good idea to get them done.  It just sucked to have a very hefty bill before our trip ... a trip where we'd have to spend on some extra hotels for the journey, etc.

### Reading 📖

If there's a theme to the books I've read/listened to in 2025, it's *history*.

So, favourite books of 2025:

- 📖 *The Opposite of Spoiled: Raising Kids Who Are Grounded, Generous, and Smart About Money* - Ron Lieber

  This is one of those books that I wish I'd read when the kids were younger, so I could have done something different around chores, money habits, etc.  Whether one agrees or disagrees with Lieber's book, the good thing about it is the discussion it should prompt on an important topic.

- 📖 *Right Thing, Right Now: Good Values. Good Character. Good Deeds.* - Ryan Holiday

  It's the third installment in his four-book Stoic Virtues series, so of course it was bought immediately!!  Like all his books, Holiday weaves together an engrossing narrative from the lives of various people to highlight the virtue under discussion (in this case, justice).  Stories from the lives of Harry Truman, Gandhi, and Jimmy Carter feature prominently in the book, as well as Florence Nightingale, Marcus Aurelius (of course!) and many others.


### Holiday experiences

Following last year's trip to see the movie *Elf* at Roy Thomson Hall, with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra playing the soundtrack live, we returned to see *Home Alone* this year, albeit only with Éamon (*Home Alone* IS his favourite Christmas movie!).  And like last year, it was very enjoyable.  This year, the second half of the performance included a choir (there's a choir scene in a church in the movie) and that was really amazing.

The following night, we all went to see the magician/comedian Justin Willman.

### Onwards

From last year ...

> I did a crappy job in reaching out to folks in 2024 ... sorry about that. I'll try to do better in 2025.

Nope!  Did even worse in 2025 <sad>


Take care of yourself and your loved ones and please let me know how 2025 was for you and to catch up in general.

Regards,<br/>
Kevin.
