## Happy New Year, 2026!

I hope you are doing well as we start 2026. Finally, I actually posted one of these on January 1! 😮‍💨

I opened last year's message with ...

> 2024 was ... something!

Apparently, I was wrong ... 2024 was *nothing* compared to 2025!  I'm not sure what to say about it, without turning this into a rant of unprintable epithets.

I don't know the impact the current occupant of the White House has had in Ireland, but in Canada it's had a rather galvanizing, patriotic effect.  It's been the year of `#Never51` (in response to Trump's idea to make Canada the 51st state), `#CanadaIsNotForSale` (thanks to a hat worn by Ontario's Premier Doug Ford),  and `#ElbowsUp` (courtesy of Mike Myers miming out the phrase on Saturday Night Live).  For the non-Canadian's, or just anyone not familiar with hockey (i.e., me!), let this picture explain everything ...

### Kids' extracurriculars 🏃🎵

There's not much to report here. Éamon continued his piano practice and participated in the end-of-school-year recital that his teacher hosts in June.

Unfortunately, while training with the school cross-country team at the end of 2024, Aidan injured his foot, then had issues with a knee, then a hip, then the other hip ... he basically spent the majority of the track & field season injured and unable to compete.  All because the geniuses leading the school cross country team trained on *pavement*, rather than grass ... you know, the stuff that cross-country runners actually run on!  For the outdoor season, Aidan didn't participate at all in any of the competitions.  There was a lot of sports massage/physiotherapy to try to fix him up!

The indoor track season is now underway and he had his first meet in mid-December ... he knocked over half-a-second off his previous PB in the 200m, so ... 🤞

### Job hunting ... again!

Towards the end of 2024, the team I was on was split into two - my previous manager retained a little over half the team, and me and a few others started reporting to a new manager.  In March, my former manager was let go, in April one of my colleagues left, and in May, I was also "right-sized", to use the euphemism.  Unlike 2022 or 2023 when Shopify did large 10% or 20% of workforce layoffs, these days there's a steady stream of layoffs, as the company is "all-in" on AI and opportunities to cut costs are paramount.  I chatted with my previous manager in early December and he mentioned there's been 8 or 9 director-level folks who're no longer with Shopify (including our own former director) and some very senior folk are also no longer there.  It's a company undergoing a major shift in culture ... and perhaps not for the better.

So, in May, I started the job hunt again.  Several of the folks reading this already know, as I emailed asking to keep an eye out for anything they thought might be suitable.  In June, one of them replied asking, "hey, I've got a problem, would you mind doing a short term contract to take a look?"  I said, "sure, would love to" ... and thus I ended up working at TELUS, again!

While the company is obviously different (it's been seven years, after all!), perhaps because it's with a team I was part of for so long, it's been surprisingly easy to slot back in, in a welcoming, comfortable sort of way.  Anyway, thanks to J&J (you know who you are!!) for keeping me out of trouble for the second half of the year!

### Vacation

Because of a bit of Canadian pride ("elbows up"), we did not venture to Florida this year, much to Éamon's consternation.  We've gone there every Spring since 2013(?), except for the pandemic years.  We were able to explain to him why we couldn't go during the pandemic years (basically, "we not allowed!") but deciding to not go voluntarily was a little more challenging to explain.

Instead, we decided to head to Halifax during the summer, and convinced my sister in Ireland to meet us there.  She'd not been there, the boys hadn't been there, and Susan and I hadn't been there since before the boys were born.

Everything was looking good until the Air Canada flight attendants went on strike 🤦  After the fiasco with Air Canada two years ago on the return flight from Florida, we didn't want to fly with them again, but their arrival times lined up better my sister's arrival from Ireland, so we said "what the heck".  In the days leading up to it, we paid closer attention to the news and, sure enough, they gave their 72 hour notice on the Wednesday before our Saturday morning flight.  Well, f%@&!

We knew there would be few other flights available so our only options were to cancel (which wasn't fair on my sister) or to drive.  In anticipation of driving, Susan suggested to get the car serviced in advance.  Wouldn't you know it, the brakes needed a full service!  In fairness, the kilometers were at that point where it really did need to be done, and, given that we were facing a round-trip of about 4,000 km ... it was probably a good idea to get them done!  It just sucked to have a very hefty bill before our trip ... a trip where we'd have to spend on some extra hotels for the journey, etc.

The road trip wasn't bad really.  We split it up into two days on the way there and three days on the way back, and it was very straight-forward.  The road surface was mostly good, except for a section of the highway in Quebec. Plenty of batteries, movies loaded on to an iPad, and Susan and I listened to a bunch of episodes of the SmartLess podcast (mindless entertainment!).

In Halifax, we did a bunch of museums, got to see the Bluenose II in Lunenberg, went to see the ubiquitous Peggy's Cove lighthouse, and ate some ridiculously delicious seafood chowder in Mahone Bay!  The weather was also very nice.  I was amazed at the amount of construction - buildings, neighbourhoods, highways - around the city since we had last been there.  It seems like a city expanding in a hurry.

### Reading 📖

If there's a theme to the books I've read/listened to in 2025, it's *history*.  I've gone through (X?) books this past year, with several from the same few authors:

- David McCullough (5): The Wright Brothers, The Path Between the Seas, Truman, John Adams, History Matters
- Walter Isaacson (5): The Code Breaker, Leonardo da Vinci, Kissinger, Benjamin Franklin, Einstein
- Ben Macintyre (5): Prisoners of the Castle, For Your Eyes Only, The Siege, The Spy and the Traitor, Agent Sonya
- Doris Kearns Goodwin (3): No Ordinary Time, The Bully Pulpit, Leadership

All four authors are fantastic writers, though Macintyre is probably my current favourite - he's a great storyteller and when he narrates his own audiobooks, they're "bloody marvelous" (say it with a British accent!).

So, putting those books aside and selecting others as favourites of 2025:

- 📖 *Be Useful* - Arnold Schwarzenegger

  The title comes from advice his father gave him, and Schwarzenegger expounds on seven ingredients to *be useful* - vision, big thinking, work ethic, influence, adaptability, open-mindedness, contribution.  It's surprisingly well written (I'm not sure if there was a ghost writer involved) and basically highlights the importance of finding your purpose, being resilient, continuously improving, being helpful to others ... you know, the common sense stuff ... but it draws on his life and experiences, which makes it an entertaining read also.

- 📖 *Wisdom Takes Work* - Ryan Holiday

  The fourth and final installment in his Stoic Virtues series, Holiday pulls stories from the lives of ??? to discuss the virtue of wisdom.  Like his many other books, it's a tapestry woven from the lives of interesting people and, as always, very well put together.


### Holiday experiences

Following last year's trip to see the movie *Elf* at Roy Thomson Hall, with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra playing the soundtrack live, we returned to see *Home Alone* this year, albeit only with Éamon (*Home Alone* IS his favourite Christmas movie!).  And like last year, it was very enjoyable.  The second half of the performance included a choir (there's a choir scene in a church in the movie) and that was really amazing.

The following night, we all went to see the magician/comedian Justin Willman.

### Onwards

From last year ...

> I did a crappy job in reaching out to folks in 2024 ... sorry about that. I'll try to do better in 2025.

Nope!  Did even worse in 2025 😞


Take care of yourself and your loved ones and please let me know how 2025 was for you and to catch up in general.

Regards,<br/>
Kevin.
