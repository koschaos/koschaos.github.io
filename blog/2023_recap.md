### Happy (belated) New Year!

I sent one of these in 2022 but didn't send one last year (couldn't be bothered?) and a few chastised me for its omission. 

I hope you are doing well as we start 2024. When I sent the last one, we were still in the pandemic; now we're *technically* not in a pandemic but there does seem to be quite a few cases of COVID going around, so I hope everyone is taking care of themselves.

### Winter 2022 (Dec '22 to Mar'23)

On January 16, 2023, my Aunt Peggy (Margaret) passed away.  She's neither my first aunt or uncle to do so nor will she be the last, but it impacted me a little more.  After leaving school, she went to work at the Cork City library in Ireland and stayed there until she retired.  In the lates 1960's, my mum also worked at that library, which is where the two of them met and became friends.

My dad wouldn't visit the city that often as it was essentially a day trip away from the farm. Keeping in mind the decade, the motor cars of the era, the roads in Ireland (really, really bad!) and it's easy to realize that the approx. 100 km trip would take around 2 hours each way.  (Even today it's only down to about 1¬Ω hours.)  So, Dad would make it worthwhile, making sure he'd visit various farm equipment stores for parts, tool vendors, etc., as it might be months before he'd be there again.  And he'd call in to see his younger sister ... who worked at the library.  

You're seeing where this is going, right?!

Yes, it was my Aunt Peggy who introduced my mum to my dad!  I believe the ~~universe~~multiverse is mathematical and life (in general) is the result of astronomical probabilities.  And so it goes for me - my very being is down to the probabilities of my aunt and my mum being born around the same time, working in the same place at the same time, my dad seeing my mum and asking for an introduction from his sister, going on a date, getting married, etc., etc.

It's all down to minuscule probabilities, but my Aunt Peggy is at the centre of it.  She had been very sick and in pain the last few years (cancer, of course) and I had spoken to her just before Christmas 2022 - she sounded very old and frail, which had not been the case on the previous occasion I had spoken with her.  I wrote a letter in late December 2022 to send to her highlighting how and why she was so important to me, but I never got to send it ... she went into hospice just after Christmas and passed away not even two weeks later.

So many lessons to glean from this - your life, your very existence, is nothing short of a (mathematical) miracle, so be grateful every day for the opportunities it presents; and don't wait to say "I love you" to those who are important and special in your life.

What else happened?  I finally burst my self-imposed COVID bubble and had drinks and a bite to eat with one of my colleagues and my new manager in January ... and with a bunch of former colleagues a week later!  It was really, really nice to get out of the damn house!!

### Spring (Mar - Jun)

In late April, about 60 team members (split across three groups) from my extended work team converged on Toronto for three days.  Although I worked in the office for about six weeks just before the world went into lockdown in March 2020, the vast majority of the team was hired after that, so I'd never met most of them.  It was really great to finally meet the majority of the team I worked with face-to-face!

Then May 4 happened, and Shopify laid off 20% of its work force.  Our own team was hit pretty hard - about 25%, including my manager, and several of the colleagues I had literally just met.

And then I was asked if I wanted to move to a different team, because business priorities demanded a reshuffle of resources.  I was conflicted - I really liked the team I was with, and enjoyed the work ... but I'd also been basically in the same area for over three years and while I'd learned lots, there's a lot more to Shopify, lots more areas to learn, so I said yes, and started in a new team in June, right after our first family vacation since 2019.

The vacation was nothing exotic - we went to Orlando (again!) and to Universal Studios (again!).  The big difference between this visit and the last time is that the boys were now that much older and therefore tall enough to go on *all* the rides.  Which is exactly what my youngest did ... many, many times ... and dragged his sunburned old man with him!  I lost count of the number of times we did the Hollywood Rip Ride Rocket, the Incredible Hulk Coaster, or Jurassic World VelociCoaster üò¨ 

We had a really enjoyable week, a fun vacation to remember.  This despite Air Canada's best attempt to sour it on the return journey - multiple cancelled flights, an overnight stay in a dumpy hotel near Charlotte, North Carolina, and a journey from Orlando to Toronto that lasted about 19 hours, instead of the original 2¬Ω hour direct flight.  At the end, we were just happy to be home!

### Summer (Jun - Sep)

In early July, my sister visited us from Ireland. Like so many in the tech industry, she was let go from her employer in June, so she took advantage of the "break" to come visit us.  She was in Canada for Canada Day, and we took in fireworks near the lake in Whitby.  We went to the farmers market in St. Jacob's, and took a ride on the [Waterloo Central Railway](https://waterloocentralrailway.com/). There was a trip to Yorkdale Mall and also an evening of horse racing and dinner at Woodbine Racetrack.  And to cap her visit, a trip to the theatre, to see "Hamilton", which was a damn good show!

The rest of the summer was basically driving the boys to town camp, the youngest to track practice, track meets, and golf camp, the oldest to various GO stations so he could shoot "railfanning" videos that would then be uploaded to YouTube (because he's a "rail enthusiast" and a "YouTuber" ... don't ask!) ... basically lots of driving!

There was also lots of movie watching. My youngest and I went through all six of the Jurassic Park/World movies, and we started making our way through the James Bond movies from the start ... wow, some of them are really bad!  So much so that we're only as far as the last '70's and Aidan can't take any more of them, for now!!  We also started going to the theatre again - "Oppenheimer", "A Haunting in Venice", "Mission Impossible 109"...!

And of course, back to school - √âamon changed high schools this year due to availability opening up in one of the special ed classrooms at his home high school, and Aidan going into his final year of public school.  Where has the time gone ... üï∞Ô∏è 

### Autumn ... or Fall! (Sep - Dec)

Start of school means start of cross-country season ... although Aidan prefers sprinting to long distance and cross-country, he *wanted* to do cross-country this year, without any prodding from his "parental units".  He did well - he came third in one of the warm up events, then first in another, and then came first again (out of 62) in the school district's meet for his school's area! In the regional final two weeks later, he came 19th out of 100+ runners - needless to say, he was disappointed but his mum and I are really proud of him!

Then it was the school volleyball team ... and cricket team ... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

What else happened?  Oh yeah, I had a cardiac procedure!  In 2018, I was diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (let's just go with A.Fib.!) and have been monitoring it ever since.  In my case, there's an elevated risk of blood clots but it's essentially considered a nuisance condition - when I'm in A.Fib., I can feel the irregular rhythm in my chest and it's just annoying and uncomfortable until it returns to a regular rhythm (that's the paroxysmal part - it's not permanent).

My cardiologist had suggested that I consider a catheter ablation procedure as the frequency and occurrence of my A.Fib. made me a really good candidate for a successful outcome, that is, no more A.Fib.!  It wasn't until late 2022 that we revisited the idea and he referred me to a specialist.

Now, should I have been a bit more worried when this guy introduced himself as an "electrician"?!  According to him, there are three types of cardiologists - a "signals" type, like my regular cardiologist, who looks at EKGs and electrocardiograms, etc.; a "plumber" - the one who puts in stents and does bypasses, they're the one you want when having a heart attack; and an "electrician" ... technically, an *electrophysiologist* ... who deals with atypical heart rhythms!

Anyway, I got put on the waitlist in January 2023, with an expected wait time of about sixteen months.  At the June follow-up, I was informed that, because the WHO lifted the pandemic designation earlier in the year, the procedures were now being filled up and I would be done in about three months ...

... and so on October 17, I was knocked out for about two hours, had thin tubes inserted into my veins near my groin, threaded up into my heart, a hole punched through one of the interior walls and small scars created, intentionally, on the inside of my heart with freezing (cryoablation).  Oh, and that was at around 8 am and I left the hospital at 3pm ... I mean, what could go wrong?!?

I still don't know if it's been a success.  I had two occurrences of A.Fib. the week after the procedure which was really disappointing but I've not noticed any since then.  I was supposed to wear a holter monitor (a mini EKG machine) for fourteen days in November and then have a follow-up appointment with the "electrician" in December but ...

... I got COVID ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è   We managed to avoid it for almost four years ... oh well. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Susan got it too, a few days after me ... the boys seemed to have escaped.  I don't appear to have any lasting effects; Susan's sense of smell still hasn't fully returned, which is both annoying and a bit concerning, but not uncommon.

I finally wore the holter monitor over Christmas and my follow-up with the cardiologist is next week ... hopefully I'll find out the procedure went well ü§û 

### Reading

I managed to get through almost 40 books last year.  I've been meaning to read Alduos Huxley's novel "Brave New World" (1928) for long time and finally did so late last year.  If one squints enough at modern society, there are enough approximate similarities between his vision of the future (from 1928!) and today's dystopia to make it a little uncanny.

The other main books that I found impactful (these are non-fiction):
- Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence - Max Tegmark
  - There's a lot of talk about AI these days (understatement of 2023!) but I first read Max Tegmark's "Life 3.0" book back in 2018 and found it ... interesting!  Re-reading it this year, it turns out to be *very* interesting, and prescient ... well worth the re-visit this year in light of ChatGPT, GPT-4, Gemini, etc.
- Our Mathematical Universe: My Quest for the Ultimate Nature of Reality - Max Tegmark
  - Before I read this book, I slogged my way through David Deutsch's "The Fabric of Reality" after listening to David on a podcast with Sam Harris and thought it would be an excellent way to stretch my view on the world, the universe, etc.  Spoiler alert - it wasn't!  "Slogged" is the key word in that last sentence!!  Max's book is far more approachable and understandable ... or as approachable and understandable as can be when it comes to discussions of universes, multi-verses and the nature of reality!!!  And just to prove to myself that I'm a complete idiot, I then decided to slog my way through David Deutsch's "The Beginning of Infinity" afterwards ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- The Coming Wave: Technology, Power, and the Twenty-First Century's Greatest Dilemma - Mustafa Suleyman, with Michael Bhaskar
  - A more recent book about AI (and synthetic biology) from one of the founders of DeepMind and, more recently, Inflection AI. Again, another book I picked up after listening to a very interesting interview between Mustafa and Scott Galloway on the latter's podcast.  It covers quite well (IMHO) the increasingly rapid development in two keys areas (and several associated related areas) that may very well impact society quite deeply in the years and decades ahead.  It paints a fairly complete picture, the good and the bad, from a leader in the AI field who leans more to the optimistic side (not a doomsayer) but he doesn't shy away from describing how it could go wrong too.
- Humankind: A Hopeful History - Rutger Bregman, translated by Erica Moore, Elizabeth Manton
  - Technically, this is on my list as a 2014 book, in that I started it in December and finished it in January! Yet another book from an author who was interviewed on Scott Galloway's podcast!! This book was really fascinating in that, in an effort to highlight that there's a lot to be hopeful about when it comes to thinking about humanity (i.e., the opposite of what you might think if you pay attention to the nightly news), he dispels so many iconic stories and studies that we've heard about (the Milgrim experiment, the Stanford prison experiment, the broken windows theory of policing, etc.) as either hoaxes or just really bad science.  At one point during reading it, it almost felt like a vendetta against some of Malcolm Gladwell's writing, who covered several of these stories in his books!

### Wrapping up

If you've made it this far, you've apparently got way too much time on your hands, and you should probably get a hobby!  Other from that, thank you for sticking with me.

The night before my ablation procedure, I sent my brother and sister in Ireland a message on WhatsApp:

> Hey, this isn't to freak you out or anything. Tomorrow is, by all accounts, a fairly routine procedure. But, shit happens sometimes, no matter how rare, so to avoid regrets later, I need to say "I love you, very much", to both of you.

And that night, I hugged my boys a bit tighter and hugged Susan a bit longer in the morning before leaving for the hospital.  It was a sobering thought that this procedure involved messing about with my heart.

In 2019, when my family and I visited Ireland after a gap of seven years, my siblings and I agreed that we'd visit each other in alternate years ... and then the pandemic happened!  Since my sister visited in 2023, it's my turn to visit my brother and sister this year.

I turn 50 later this year and if I'm lucky enough to have 25-30 more years where I'm healthy enough to travel, that's just 25-30 more times I'll get to see my sister.  It's only half that for my brother - since he can't afford to take time away from the farm to come visit us in Canada, we'll only see each other in person when we go to Ireland.

Several of the folks receiving this aren't physically close to their parents or family.  I know from experience that it's easy for the physical distance to become mental distance ("out-of-sight, out-of-mind"), not through any malice or intention ... just through the distance.

Try to reach out to your family more often than you think you should - yes, it might stir up annoyances (it is family, after all!) but in the long run I don't think you'll regret it.  I know I need to do it more myself.

'Til next time, take care of yourself, and feel free to reach out. I'd love to hear how 2023 was for you, if any interesting books or podcasts grabbed your attention, and just to catch up in general.

Regards,
Kevin.
