### Happy New Year ... ish!

Belated Happy New Year (Gregorian calendar) and Happy New Year (Lunar calendar)!

I've been meaning to send this for a while but keep putting it off.

I hope you are doing well as we start 2022, still in the middle of a pandemic although hopefully we're finally turning a corner to realize that we're just going to have to live with it, like a seasonal flu ... maybe ... ?

We were invited to join one of my son's classmates to go tobogganing today.  We almost didn't go, as we've been quite conservative in getting out more, erring on the side of caution and isolating.

In the end, we all went - Cócó the dog too - and had a great time.  The boys had a tonne of fun and it felt _really_ great to get out and do something!

### Memento Mori
For those who need to brush up on your Latin, that means "remember, you will die".  How's that for a new year's greeting?!

> Happy New Year!  Remember, you will die!!

No one really wants to think about death, especially their own, but I've been pondering it a lot over the last couple of years.  Coronavirus and COVID-19 have perhaps brought it into sharper focus.  I'm generally healthy ... OK, I could loose a few - or twenty - pounds.  Well, either that or grow another maybe 8 inches taller, but I'm not holding much hope of that happening!

No, my wife and I have been very cautious for the last few years because of the pandemic, driven by the realization that if anything were to happen to us, we're really not sure what would happen to the boys, in terms of guardianship, etc.  That thought has been a mentally stressful one to have and hold onto.

Once you start thinking about it, it really does bring one's own mortality into focus.  I turned 47 in December, which means I'm 57% through my life, statistically speaking (assuming a current life expectancy of 82).  That's likely a best case, given both my parents died earlier than that.  It's a very sobering thought.

### Finding meaning
If you haven't read "Man's Search for Meaning" by Victor Frankl, I'd strongly recommend it (I re-read it last year).  Dr. Frankl was a concentration camp survivor from World War II, and got to see up close the mental trials that those interned went through, who survived better mentally and those who didn't.  He developed his psychological theory, called logotherapy ("healing through meaning"), prior to entering the concentration camps, but his experiences there cemented his belief in his theory, and the importance of finding meaning in ones life.

During 2021, I also went through "Being Mortal" by Atul Guwande (he of "The Checklist Manifesto" fame), where he examines the history of geriatric medicine, which becomes ever more important as people live longer and longer.  It's very well written, often sad, especially when he writes about his father's passing and the hard decisions in the time leading up to that.  They're decisions we'll all need to make, be it for parents or for ourselves and I think Dr. Guwande makes some great points about how to think about those decisions.

### Stoicism
Returning to *memento mori*, I've taken a strong interest in Stoicism and learning from the Stoic philosophers in the last twelve months.  Thinking about death features strongly in Stoicism, not in a morbid sense but in a clarifying sense.  Ultimately living a good life, of purpose and service.  I'm still trying to figure it out, failing daily, and trying again.

That's all I can do. Try my best, learn from it, try again the next day.

I suppose that's my point - many of you receiving this are younger (a lot younger!) than 47!  Don't wait as long as I have to learn this valuable point of view.

### Reading
Or, listening to audiobooks, in my case.  I managed to get through 27 books this year, which is closer to the typical amount I read in a year but down quite a bit from the 53 I read in 2020!  Reading provides great comfort to me, in that I'm learning (hopefully) from the many voices I let into my life.

I suppose the main reason I didn't get through as many books is because 2021 was also the year of the podcast for me!  I've always listened to a few podcasts but I got hooked into a lot more last year.  I finally caught up (from episode 1 to present) of "The Knowledge Project" with Shane Parrish, which are very interesting interviews with a range of different people, from different backgrounds.

The podcast that currently has my attention is "Bookworm" with Joe Buhlig and Mike Schmitz where they document their thoughts on ... books!  I'm about two-thirds through their catalogue of episodes.  The main challenge with that podcast?   It only adds to my reading to-do list!


### Onward
I wanted to say sorry for referring so much to the bleak topic of death ... but I'm also not sorry!  My main intent is for you to actually think about it, to not put it off, as difficult as it may be, because it provide a great lens to see what's really important for you.

It is ultimately the one thing that unites us all; the one event that we will all experience.  Birth is obviously another one - I'm not sure about you but I don't remember much of mine!

And don't worry ... I'm not in some dark place!  I suppose, ironically, I'm actually looking forward to learn more, about Stoicism, about the meaning of life.  It might be easy to ask "what's the point" but, for me, it's a stark reminder to ask "what's important to me and how can I make a difference".

Some of you reached out to me last year to ask my advice.  That meant quite a lot actually, to me, and I felt quite humbled to be asked.

What have I learned this past year?  That relationships are ultimately the greatest part of life, perhaps the greatest source of joy ... and that I mainly suck at them!  I miss connecting with all of you, and I'm sorry I don't keep in touch more ... I'll try better this year.

'Til next time, take care of yourself, and feel free to reach out.  I'd love to hear how 2021 was for you, if any interesting books or podcasts grabbed your attention, and just to catch up in general.

Regards,
Kevin.
